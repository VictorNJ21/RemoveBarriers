# RemoveBarriers
RemoveBarriers removes all barriers on the map. This is part of an old slice of code I found on the internet and made it work. I know there is a YMAP for this that removes the barriers at Legion, but I find that extremely useless as it only removes the barriers at Legion and messes up other existing YMAPs. 

I kindly ask you to report any bug/suggestion down below.
